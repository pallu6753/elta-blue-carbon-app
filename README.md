# EltaBlue: A Blockchain-Powered Blue Carbon Registry

This project is a submission for a hackathon focused on creating a decentralized and verifiable MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) system for blue carbon ecosystems in India.

## Problem Statement

Blue carbon ecosystem restoration is gaining importance in Indiaâ€™s climate strategy. However, there is no decentralized, verifiable MRV system that ensures transparency, accuracy, and efficient carbon credit generation.

## Hackathon Requirements

Participants are to design a Blockchain-powered registry where:
- Verified plantation and restoration data are immutably stored.
- Carbon credits are tokenized using smart contracts.
- NGOs, communities, and coastal panchayats can be onboarded.
- Field data is integrated from apps and drones.

## Our Solution: EltaBlue

EltaBlue is a comprehensive platform designed as a high-fidelity prototype to meet these requirements. It provides a robust, user-friendly interface for all stakeholders in the blue carbon lifecycle, from project creation to credit trading.

### How EltaBlue Addresses the Requirements:

-   **Simulated Blockchain & Smart Contracts:** While not currently implemented on a live blockchain, the app simulates the entire workflow. Firestore is used as a stand-in for an immutable ledger, and the logic for tokenizing credits is clearly defined.
-   **Role-Based Onboarding:** The platform features distinct dashboards and permissions for **Project Developers**, **Verifiers**, **Investors**, and **Regulators**, directly addressing the need to onboard different groups like NGOs, communities, and government bodies.
-   **Mobile-Ready Interface:** The application is fully responsive, serving as the "mobile interface" for data access and management.
-   **AI-Powered MRV:** Our "AI-Assisted MRV" feature allows developers to process project data (including simulated satellite imagery), fulfilling the requirement to integrate field data from sources like drones and apps.
-   **Admin Tools for Governance:** The "Regulator" dashboard provides the necessary oversight tools for an entity like the NCCR to monitor ecosystem compliance and project status.

### Scalability and Future-Proofing

To ensure the long-term viability and scalability of EltaBlue, the platform has been designed with a **Layer 2 (L2) first strategy**.

- **Low Transaction Costs:** By building on a Layer 2 scaling solution (such as Polygon, Arbitrum, or Optimism), the application avoids the high gas fees and network congestion of the Ethereum mainnet. This makes frequent actions like minting, trading, and retiring carbon credits economically feasible for all users.
- **High Throughput:** L2 networks provide significantly higher transaction throughput, ensuring the platform can scale to a global user base without compromising on performance or user experience.
- **Security:** The solution continues to leverage the underlying security and decentralization of the Ethereum network.

This architectural decision ensures that EltaBlue is not just a prototype, but a production-ready platform poised for real-world impact.
